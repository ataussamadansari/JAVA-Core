🔁 What is Recursion in Java?
    Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve a smaller part of the problem until a base condition is met.

✅ Important Points about Recursion:
    Base Case is a must – Prevents infinite recursion and stops the function.

    Recursive Case – The part where the function calls itself.

    Stack Memory – Each recursive call uses stack memory. Too many calls can lead to StackOverflowError.

    Used for problems that can be broken into smaller, similar sub-problems (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, tree traversal, etc.).

    Should be optimized – If not written carefully, recursion can be inefficient.

📌 Syntax (General Pattern):
        returnType methodName(parameters) {
            if (base condition) {
                return some value;
            } else {
                return methodName(modified parameters); // recursive call
            }
        }

💡 Example: Factorial using Recursion
        public class RecursionExample {

            // Recursive method to calculate factorial
            static int factorial(int n) {
                if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
                    return 1; // base case
                } else {
                    return n * factorial(n - 1); // recursive case
                }
            }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int number = 5;
                int result = factorial(number);
                System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is: " + result);
            }
        }

Output:
Factorial of 5 is: 120

⚠️ When to Avoid Recursion:
    If performance or memory is a concern (consider iteration instead).
    Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow.
